    <h1>User Signup Page</h1>

    <p>This program implements a simple user signup process where users can choose a username and password. It checks if the chosen username is available, saves the user's information to a file, and creates a user-specific file for additional information.</p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>The <code>signup.c</code> program provides a user-friendly way for users to sign up with a username and password. It ensures that the chosen username is unique by checking against existing usernames in the "users.txt" file. If the chosen username is available, the user's information is saved in the same file, and a user-specific file is created for any additional information.</p>

    <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Users are prompted to choose a username.</li>
        <li>The program checks if the chosen username is already taken by reading the "users.txt" file.</li>
        <li>If the username is taken, users are prompted to choose a different username.</li>
        <li>Users are then prompted to choose a password.</li>
        <li>The program saves the user's username and password to the "users.txt" file.</li>
        <li>A user-specific file is created to store additional information if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Compile and run the program using a C compiler.</li>
        <li>Follow the prompts to choose a username and password.</li>
        <li>If the username is available and the user is successfully saved, a confirmation message will be displayed.</li>
        <li>If the user-specific file is created, a confirmation message will be displayed.</li>
    </ol>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project provides a basic implementation of the Snake and Ladder game using the C programming language. The game is played in the terminal and allows multiple players to roll dice and move on the game board. The game board includes snakes and ladders that can affect the players' positions.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The game is played on a 10x10 board with 100 squares.</li>
    <li>There are 10 players participating in the game.</li>
    <li>Players take turns rolling a dice and moving the corresponding number of squares.</li>
    <li>The objective is to reach the 100th square to win the game.</li>
    <li>Snakes and ladders are present on the board, affecting player positions.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The game will display the initial positions of all players on the board.</li>
    <li>Players take turns rolling the dice by pressing Enter.</li>
    <li>The dice roll value is displayed, and the player's position is updated accordingly.</li>
    <li>Snakes and ladders are applied when a player lands on their respective squares.</li>
    <li>The game continues until a player reaches the 100th square, winning the game.</li>
</ol>
